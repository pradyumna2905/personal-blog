Hi, I am Pradyumna Shembekar.
I am currently working at ClearStack, Inc. as a Ruby developer. Most of the
time you'll find me on the terminal.

Currently, I am working on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

I use vim to write code, draft ideas, and create grocery lists.

I like to automate menial tasks, hence I love aliasing and bash functions. (I
may spend a lot of time on automating a small repetitive task.)

Because I am a millenial, here is my social precence.
